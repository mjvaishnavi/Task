    <p>The Indian peacock, Pavo cristatus, the national bird of India, is a colourful, swan-sized bird, with a fan-shaped crest of feathers, a white patch under the eye and a long, slender neck. The male of the species is more colourful than the female, with a glistening blue breast and neck and a spectacular bronze-green tail of around 200 elongated feathers. The female is brownish, slightly smaller than the male and lacks the tail. The elaborate courtship dance of the male, fanning out the tail and preening its feathers is a gorgeous sight.<br>The peacock is the most beautiful bird in the world. It is a tall but slender bird with a long feather tail. The bird has different shades of blue and green feathers. Peacocks can spread out their long feathers like an umbrella revealing hundreds of eye-like patterns. Only the male peacocks have these beautiful feathers and use them to attract the peahens. The peacock is famous for its courtship dance with the females. Having such unique characteristics, it is the national bird of India. Since peacocks are protected birds, they cannot be kept as pets at home. You can enjoy watching peacocks from a distance in their natural environment.<br>There are mainly two types of peacocks in the world- the Indian peacock and the Burmese peacock. The Indian peacock can grow as long as 195 to 225 cm from head to tail. They can weigh up to 5 kilos when fully mature. The colour is iridescent blue with some green hues in the feathers. The feather of the peacock is called a train. An adult peacock can have over 200 of these long feathers. Each feather has a beautiful oval-shaped eye at the end of the feather. Together they give a beautifully symmetric eye-like pattern to the tail.</p>
